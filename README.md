# ryxpress: Python version of rixpress

If you’re looking for rixpress, the R package version [look here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress).

This is a thin wrapper around the R rixpress package, used to build
reproducible analytical pipelines. The pipeline’s definition is an R
script still, but it can be built from a Python session. Loading and
managing artifacts can be done from a Python session as well.

## Getting started

Because Nix is used as the build engine, Nix is required.
