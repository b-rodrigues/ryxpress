# ryxpress

`ryxpress` is a Python reimplementation/port of the R package rixpress. It
provides helpers and a small framework to build and work with reproducible,
multilanguage analytical pipelines that are built with Nix. `ryxpress` requires
an installation of R and `rixpress` to run, but this can be handled quite
easily and transparently thanks to Nix.

If you previously used the R version (`rixpress`), `ryxpress` aims to provide a
similar user experience for Python projects while integrating with the same
Nix-first workflow.
